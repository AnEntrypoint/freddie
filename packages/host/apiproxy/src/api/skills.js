/**
 * skills domain contract: read-only skill catalog lookup addressed by session.
 * The session's header cwd resolves to the canonical project root host-side —
 * the client never submits a raw path, and skill lookup never creates or
 * resumes an Agent.
 *
 * This file is pure types in TS and carries no runtime code.
